Android for ARMv6 [ RaspberryPi Edition ] - CyanogenMod 11.0
===========


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android for ARMv6/CyanogenMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html).


To initialize your local repository for creating Cyanogenmod 11.0 for the RaspberryPi
You need to download and run the vendor initialize script.

    curl -L http://goo.gl/WQPdtQ > vendorinit.sh > vendorinit.sh
    sudo chmod 755 vendorinit.sh
    source vendorinit.sh
    [See Notes for more info]


  

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Build your device:

    source build/envsetup.sh
    lunch rpi-eng
    make -j4 


Notes
-----
The vendorinit.sh Script carries out 2 tasks
1. runs the standard repo init to get the cm-11.0 androidarmv6 manifest 

repo init -u git://github.com/androidarmv6/android.git -b cm-11.0


2. Downloads the RaspberryPi specific local manifest.

It's a tough world out there and basically you're on your own.

what they want you to do Make it on your own,"
